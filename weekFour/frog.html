            <p id="mainText"> A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura 
                (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar,
                 but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago.
                  Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainfor
                  Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. 
                  Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal,
                 not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.
